Given Task:
Task 1:
Create a node that publishes some dummy string to a topic.
Subscribe to this topic in another node and print out the string so as to ensure that they are working

I used python to code the publisher and subscriber nodes and then I launched them from the terminal to display the published and subscribed String.
