Given Task:
Install turtlebot3 (you may use the following link for help).
Control turtlebot3 using ROS and arrow keys.
Now, record the topics that are being published onto a bag file. Save this bag file.
Read the velocity of turtlebot3 from the bag file that you previously recorded. Add some gaussian noise to this and publish it to a new topic. You may print out these values to check if they are being published correctly.


I installed all the package dependencies for turtle bot.
Gazebo is working fine but the bot is not being spawned.
The terminal throws me an error message saying that turtlebot_gazebo is not a recognized launch file. I am working on debugging this issue.
